## Description
This project serves as the final assignment for the CS50P course. It revolves around a card game where 10 cards are dealt to 2 players, and 4 cards are placed on the table, forming 4 rows. Each player chooses a card, and the one who selects the card with the lowest value places it at the beginning or end of the row whose number is closest.

As cards are added, the rows become larger, and when a row reaches a size of 6 cards, the player who placed the last card loses the game.
